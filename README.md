# FLOSS IoT dashboard (inside Foundations)

This project will support the maintenance and evolution of the FLOSS IoT dashboard.

In the last decade, Industry 4.0 has emerged as a revolution for the traditional industry technology, 
and the Internet of Things (IoT) is at the core of it. Apache, Eclipse and Linux foundations, 
three of the main actors in Open Source, have put in place their own IoT architectures powered 
by different Open Source projects. 

More than 50 projects from these foundations have been selected, classified and  
analyzed with the goal of understanding the IoT landscape in FLOSS. 

For each project, activity and community data extracted from Git and Github 
is analyzed using the GrimoireLab platform, a powerful Open Source tool for 
software analytics. The data obtained is used to understand the 
Open Source IoT landscape in terms of companies involved, leading projects, 
technologies adopted and communities.

The result is a dashboard that you can build yourself [following this instructions](DASHBOARD.md).

And there is an online version at: https://iotfloss.bitergia.net/

The dashboard was first presented at the
[IoT devroom at FOSDEM 2020](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/iotfoundation/).

# CONTRIBUTING

The dashboard at its core is based on:

* Project selection
* Categories definition
* Metrics and visualizations to show the insights

Please, help us to understand better the IoT FLOSS world opening issues or collaborating
in existing ones to improve it.
